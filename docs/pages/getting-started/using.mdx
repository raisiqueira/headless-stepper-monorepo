# Using Headless Stepper

Create a component that will use Headless Stepper is too easy. Basically, you need to import the hook and create an instance to all objects that we need, or you can destructure the props that the `useStepper()` hook returns.

You, as developer, are responsible for rendering the UI. This guide will show you how to use the hook and how to render the UI (without styles).

## Starting from the basic

When thinking about a stepper component, you imagine something with labels, and buttons to trigger an action and go to the next step, so,let's see how to use the hook in a simple case.

First of all, we need to import the hook.

```tsx
import { useStepper } from 'headless-stepper';
```

Now, let's create the steps:

```tsx
const steps = React.useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      label: 'Step 1',
    },
    { label: 'Step 2' },
    { label: 'Step 3' },
    { label: 'Step 4', disabled: true },
    { label: 'Step 5' },
    { label: 'Step 6' },
  ],
  []
);
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  We're using `React.useMemo` to avoid `useStepper` doesn't recalculate on every
  single render. Only when the memoized value actually changes!
</Callout>

## Using the `useStepper()` hook

Now that you have the steps, you can use the `useStepper()` hook to create the stepper.

```tsx
const stepperInstance = useStepper({ steps });
```

Or, if you want to destructure the props, you can do it like this:

```tsx
const { state, nextStep, prevStep, progressProps, stepsProps, stepperProps } =
  useStepper({ steps });
```

As you can see, the hook receives an object with the steps list. These steps list might be a simple array of objects. Now, let's build the UI.

## Building the UI

```tsx
return (
  <div>
    <div>
      <nav style={{ display: 'flex' }} {...stepperProps}>
        {stepsProps?.map((step, index) => (
          <ol key={index}>
            <a {...step}>{steps[index].label}</a>
          </ol>
        ))}
      </nav>
    </div>
    <p>Current step: {state.currentStep}</p>
    <button onClick={prevStep} disabled={!state.hasPreviousStep}>
      Prev
    </button>
    <button onClick={nextStep}>Next</button>
    <div {...progressProps} />
  </div>
);
```

And, this is the final result:

## Accessibility notes

The stepper props that `useStepper()` hook returns is treated as a tab component with the `role="tablist"` for the steps wrapper, and `role="tab"` for each step.

Inspect the above example and you'll see that the `aria-selected` attribute is set to `true` for the current step.

### Keyboard interaction

| Keyboard key | Description                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Tab`        | Focus on first step or focus on the current step |
| `ArrowLeft`  | Go to previous step.                             |
| `ArrowRight` | Go to next step.                                 |
| `Enter`      | Select the focused step.                         |
| `Space`      | Select the focused step.                         |
