# Using the Stepper component

This component is used to display a list of steps that the user can navigate through.
Like the `useStepper` hook, the `Stepper` component does not have its own style. It is up to you to style it.
The stepper component has a prop called `as` to help with this. So, you can use your own component to be the stepper.

The `headless-stepper` provides two components to build your own stepper: `Stepper` and `Step`. Let's see how to use them.

## Starting from the basic

The `Stepper` component is a wrapper around the `useStepper` hook. It takes the same props as the hook, and it also takes an `as` prop to render the stepper.

Let's build a simple stepper that has 3 steps.

```jsx
import { Stepper, Step } from 'headless-stepper';

const MyAwesomeStepper = () => {
  return (
    <Stepper currentStep={0}>
      <Step label="Step 1">Step 1 content</Step>

      <Step label="Step 2">Step 2 content</Step>

      <Step label="Step 3">Step 3 content</Step>
    </Stepper>
  );
};

export default MyAwesomeStepper;
```

As we can see, is easy to build a simple wizard. But, we can do better. Let's improve the stepper by adding a _disabled_ step.
The `Stepper` component will automatically disable the steps that are not reachable.

```jsx
import { Stepper, Step } from 'headless-stepper';

const MyAwesomeStepper = () => {
  return (
    <Stepper currentStep={0}>
      <Step label="Step 1">Step 1 content</Step>

      <Step label="Step 2" disabled>
        Step 2 content
      </Step>

      <Step label="Step 3">Step 3 content</Step>
    </Stepper>
  );
};

export default MyAwesomeStepper;
```

The above code will be rendered as:

<StepperBasicExample />

## Using the `as` prop

Both the `Stepper` and `Step` components have an `as` prop. This prop is used to render the component that will be used as.

Let's improve the stepper by using the `as` prop to render a group of steps. To do this, we will use the [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) as UI library.

```jsx
import { Stepper, Step } from 'headless-stepper';
import { MantineProvider, Button, Group, Container, Box } from '@mantine/core';

const MyAwesomeStepper = () => {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS>
      <Container mt="lg">
        <Stepper as={Group} currentStep={0} className="example">
          <Step as={Button} label="Step 1">
            <Box>Step 1 content</Box>
          </Step>

          <Step as={Button} label="Step 2" disabled>
            Step 2 content
          </Step>

          <Step as={Button} label="Step 3">
            Step 3 content
          </Step>
        </Stepper>
      </Container>
    </MantineProvider>
  );
};

export default MyAwesomeStepper;
```

<br />

<StepperWithAsProps />

We can see that the `as` prop is really helpful for personalizing the stepper. To depict the steps, you can use any component you choose. Point out that line 9, which creates a `Group` component, and that each line that has a Step component creates a `Button` component to represent the Steps.

## Accessibility notes

The `Stepper` component is fully accessible. It uses the `useStepper` hook to manage the state of the stepper.
So, you can use the keyboard to interact with the stepper.

### Keyboard interaction

| Keyboard key | Description                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Tab`        | Focus on first step or focus on the current step |
| `ArrowLeft`  | Go to previous step.                             |
| `ArrowRight` | Go to next step.                                 |
| `Enter`      | Select the focused step.                         |
| `Space`      | Select the focused step.                         |
