# Installation

You can install using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/), but you can use it with [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/) too.

## NPM

```bash
npm install --save headless-stepper
```

## Yarn

```bash
yarn add headless-stepper
```

## PNPM

```

## UNPKG (as UMD module)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Only versions prior to the 1.3.0 can use the UMD bundle.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/headless-stepper@VERSION/index.umd.js"></script>
